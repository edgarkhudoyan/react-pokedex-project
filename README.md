# Part 1: Building Components

### The pokedex should use 3 components:

## App

### This should just render a single Pokedex.

## Pokecard

### Shows a single Pokemon, with their name, image, and type.

## Pokedex

### Is provided, via props, an array of objects describing different pokemon, and renders a series of Pokecard components.

### For each pokemon, their image source should be: ** https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/detail/${id}.png **
